# Origin Marker ðŸŽ† 
Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/originmarker/  
A browser extension to allow users to easily identify phishing domains all done client side.  
With a marker in the bookmarks bar that changes based off the active origin/domain the user is viewing.  
It can be renamed per origin manually or automatic using the hash of the origin encoded in emoji.

# How to setup
1. Get the extension
2. Add a folder to the bookmarks bar with the ID of the mode like * as the name.
3. It will then automatically get renamed.

# Recommendation
Do not enable bookmark sync between devices.

# How to use
Rename the folder/marker on the origin or just use Automatic mode.  
When you rename a marker it will not change the mode so you can have a marker named *

# Universal Automatic mode (ID: *)
If no Marker name is set emojis will be used to identify the origin.  
This works by using a sha256 hash of the origin encoded into emoji.

# Personal Automatic mode (ID: **)
Like Universal mode but with a personal salt.
It will be different emojis per origin then other users. 

# Manual only (ID: ***)
Markers will not get a automatic value.

# Origin
The Origin is based of the protocol, hostname and port number of a URL
